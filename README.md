# IMTUE-Eindproject

```March 10th 2021```
 
As part of my studies about User Experience and User Interface Design, I had to make an 
accessible website using the ```WAI-ARIA``` (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
specification. Besides ```WAI-ARIA```, I also had to incorporate keyboard navigation and the implementation of a 
screen reader to help users with a disability in using the website.

The main goal was to create a webshop with products and a contact form that were made using UI/UX patterns. 
I am really into sneakers and the subject was for me to choose, so I went with sneakers.

One of the biggest challenge I had during this project was focussing the right text for the screen reader, 
to only read the highlighted parts and read the intended texts.
